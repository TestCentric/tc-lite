Title: About TC-Lite
---
TC-Lite is a lightweight test framework in the spirit of NUnitLite, aimed at the creation and execution of fast, independent micro-tests. Tests are self-executing, being incorporated in an executable assembly, and require no additional infrastructure beyond the framework itself.

Work on TC-Lite is ongoing and the software is considered as alpha-level. Features will be added and removed from time to time until there is a 1.0 release.
