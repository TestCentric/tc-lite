<p>The <b>TC-Lite</b> framework is currently under early development. Features will be added and even removed! The documentation is constantly changing so I suggest you refresh these pages from time to time.</p>

@foreach(IDocument child in Model.DocumentList(Keys.Children).OrderBy(x => x.Get<int>(DocsKeys.Order, 1000)))
{
    <h2>@(child.String(Keys.Title))</h2>
    if(child.ContainsKey(DocsKeys.Description))
    {
        <p>@Html.Raw(child.String(DocsKeys.Description))</p>
    }

    @Html.Partial("_ChildPages", child)
}
