Title: CategoryAttribute
Description: Allows tagging tests with a category.

The **Category** attribute allows tests to be grouped arbitrarily, across the entire assembly.
Either individual test cases or fixtures may be identified as belonging to a particular category.
The test runner allows selection of tests for execution based on categories.
